# Welcome to GDScheduler

**GDScheduler** is an open-source productivity manager designed for student clubs and small organizations that need to track tasks effectively. Itâ€™s a no-BS app with a simple setup and interface, allowing project managers to automatically track and flag team members who haven't completed their assigned tasks.

The app currently uses **Clerk** for authentication and role management, and **Firebase** for cloud storage and database management.
